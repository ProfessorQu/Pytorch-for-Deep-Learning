[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab.\n",

Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",

        ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" or \"Edit > Clear Outputs\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

        "Try answering the following questions to test your understanding of the topics covered in this notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is a linear regression model? Give an example of a problem formulated as a linear regression model.\n",
        "  * A linear regression model is a machine learning model that is used to determine a number of numbers from some inputs, that are also numbers. It can commonly be used for problems where you want to, for example, figure out how many apples there will be when the weather has these en these predictions.\n",
        "2. What are input and target variables in a dataset? Give an example.\n",
        "  * Inputs are numbers with which you want to predict the targets. So I'll have one apple as input and 2 as output.\n",
        "3. What are weights and biases in a linear regression model?\n",
        "  * Weights are numbers to multiple the inputs with, and biases are numbers to add after you multiplied the inputs.\n",
        "4. How do you represent tabular data using PyTorch tensors?\n",
        "  * You can have every row be a set of inputs.\n",
        "5. Why do we create separate matrices for inputs and targets while training a linear regression model?\n",
        "  * Because we want to figure out what the difference is between the prediction, given the output, with the targets.\n",
        "6. How do you determine the shape of the weights matrix & bias vector given some training data?\n",
        "  * The number of weights is equal to the number of inputs, and the number of biases is equal to the number of outputs.\n",
        "7. How do you create randomly initialized weights & biases with a given shape?\n",
        "  * `torch.rand`\n",
        "8. How is a linear regression model implemented using matrix operations? Explain with an example.\n",
        "  * `y = X * wT + b`, or prediction is equal to the inputs multiplied by the weights and then the biases added on top of that.\n",
        "9. How do you generate predictions using a linear regression model?\n",
        "  * `nn.Linear(<inputs>, <outputs>)`. Then use `model(<inputs>)`, to make predictions.\n",
        "10. Why are the predictions of a randomly initialized model different from the actual targets?\n",
        "  * Because it's very unlikely that when you initialize a random model, that it will have the exact correct values to figure out what the output should look like given a certain input.\n",
        "11. What is a loss function? What does the term “loss” signify?\n",
        "  * A loss function is a function that determines how far off a model is. \"loss\" means how much it's \"losing\", or how inaccurate it is.\n",
        "12. What is mean squared error?\n",
        "  * A loss function that takes the error of all predictions, then it squares them and takes the mean value. That's why mean (of the) squared error (loss).\n",
        "13. Write a function to calculate mean squared using model predictions and actual targets.\n",
        "  * Here it is:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Calculate the difference between the predictions and the targets\n",
        "diff = t1 - t2\n",
        "# Sum the squared error to get the mean\n",
        "return torch.sum(diff * diff) / diff.numel()\n",
        "```\n",
        "14. What happens when you invoke the `.backward` function on the result of the mean squared error loss function?\n",
        "  * You'll get gradients that try to minimize the loss function.\n",
        "15. Why is the derivative of the loss w.r.t. the weights matrix itself a matrix? What do its elements represent?\n",
        "  * How far each weight should be shifted to get 0 on the loss function.\n",
        "16. How is the derivate of the loss w.r.t. a weight element useful for reducing the loss? Explain with an example.\n",
        "  * Because then we are able to shift the weight to a local minumum so that it's more accurate.\n",
        "17. Suppose the derivative of the loss w.r.t. a weight element is positive. Should you increase or decrease the element’s value slightly to get a lower loss?\n",
        "  * Decrease it to get decrease the loss function.\n",
        "18. Suppose the derivative  of the loss w.r.t. a weight element is negative. Should you increase or decrease the element’s value slightly to get a lower loss?\n",
        "  * Increase it to, again, decrease the loss function.\n",
        "19. How do you update the weights and biases of a model using their respective gradients to reduce the loss slightly?\n",
        "  * By subtracting the gradients, but first multiply those gradients by a small amount so that it won't overshoot after every learning example.\n",
        "20. What is the gradient descent optimization algorithm? Why is it called “gradient descent”?\n",
        "  * Because it uses gradients (slopes) to descent the loss function.\n",
        "21. Why do you subtract a “small quantity” proportional to the gradient from the weights & biases, not the actual gradient itself?\n",
        "  * Because we want to take small steps toward the mimimum, if we take giant leaps, it might overshoot.\n",
        "22. What is learning rate? Why is it important?\n",
        "  * How much we should adjust the weights and biases.\n",
        "23. What is `torch.no_grad`?\n",
        "  * Don't calculate the gradients.\n",

        "  * `w.grad.zero_()`\n",

        "  2.   Calculate the loss\n",
        "  3.   Compute gradients w.r.t. the weights and biases\n",

        "  * One time trained over the entire database.\n",
        "27. What is the benefit of training a model for multiple epochs?\n",
        "  * Because then it can then learn better,b because it goes over it more.\n",
        "28. How do you make predictions using a trained model?\n",
        "  * `model(<inputs)`\n",
        "29. What should you do if your model’s loss doesn’t decrease while training? Hint: learning rate.\n",
        "  * Increase the learning rate, because it's probably too small to make any difference.\n",
        "30. What is `torch.nn`?\n",
        "  * A module from PyTorch that has a few built-in functions and classes for things that are commonly done when using machine learning.\n",
        "31. What is the purpose of the `TensorDataset` class in PyTorch? Give an example.\n",
        "  * It is a list of tuples, each containing two tensors, one is the inputs and the other is the respective outputs. (torch.tensor([1]), torch.tensor([2]))\n",
        "32. What is a data loader in PyTorch? Give an example.\n",
        "  * A dataloader is a way to load data from a dataset in PyTorch. You can specify the batch size and if they should shuffle the data.\n",
        "33. How do you use a data loader to retrieve batches of data?\n",
        "  * You can use it in a for-loop, `for x, y in dataloader`\n",
        "34. What are the benefits of shuffling the training data before creating batches?\n",
        "  * Because that way it can't predict what data is next, and if a few data points are similar in a row, that won't affect the model as much.\n",
        "35. What is the benefit of training in small batches instead of training with the entire dataset?\n",
        "  * Because then it can adjust itself to those small batches.\n",
        "36. What is the purpose of the `nn.Linear` class in PyTorch? Give an example.\n",
        "  * To create a linear model without having to write anything yourself.\n",
        "37. How do you see the weights and biases of a `nn.Linear` model?\n",
